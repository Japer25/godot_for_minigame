# Release process

Godot Mini Game releases are built from immutable Git tags. The tag workflow
runs the complete JavaScript, GDScript, WeChat, Douyin, and TikTok export matrix before
it is allowed to publish GitHub Release assets.

## 1. Choose and apply the version

Use a new semantic version. Never move or reuse an existing tag, including a
tag whose workflow failed.

Update the version in all release-facing sources:

- `addons/godot_mini_game/plugin.cfg`
- `support-matrix.json`
- `website/package.json`
- the root package version entries in `website/package-lock.json`
- the compatibility rows in `README.md` and `README_zh.md`

Then regenerate derived website data:

```bash
cd website
npm run generate:data
cd ..
```

`support-matrix.json` is authoritative for the project-validated Godot, Emscripten,
profile, target, revision, ABI, and schema tuple. Do not publish a version when
the bundled `addons/godot_mini_game/engine/template.json` disagrees with that
tuple.

Per-platform validation lives under `platformContracts`. A certified row's
`platforms.* = automated` value means the exporter smoke job is generated; it
does **not** mean the package has passed platform DevTools or a real device.

## 2. Validate the exact release source

Run the project contracts and website checks:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh

NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/godot_for_minigame npm --prefix website test
./scripts/package_plugin.sh
```

The test runner requires Node.js 22+ and the exact Godot editor listed in
`support-matrix.json`. Set `NODE_BIN` or `GODOT_BIN` when they are not on PATH.
It runs GDScript tests in a temporary project with the committed Web preset,
without replacing a developer's `export_presets.cfg`. JavaScript-only checks
can also run directly with `node --test test/*.test.mjs` on a fresh checkout.

TikTok Native is a beta target with an additional release gate. Export a fresh
TikTok package from the release candidate, then:

1. complete `ttmg setup`/`ttmg login`, run `ttmg init` inside the fresh export
   with its Client Key, then compile/debug it through `ttmg dev` using the
   pinned version declared in `support-matrix.json` (currently
   `0.4.1-beta.wasm1`), and require CI's
   offline package precheck through `ttmg-pack.checkPkgs` to pass; Native
   `ttmg build` is currently a placeholder and is not a release gate;
2. run it on a TikTok client 43.4.0 or newer;
3. verify boot, `TTWebAssembly`, both generated subpackages, input, audio,
   networking, persistence, and login;
4. record the DevTool and device evidence with the release notes.

The TikTok HTML runtime is outside the v0.3 release scope. Do not substitute an
HTML preview for the Native DevTool and real-device gate.

When the engine template changes, also validate the original artifact produced
locally or by **Build Mini-Game WASM Template**:

```bash
./scripts/verify_wasm_template.sh /absolute/path/to/template-bundle.zip
```

The verifier accepts a ZIP or directory containing exactly `template.json`,
`version.txt`, `godot.js`, `godot.wasm.br`, and `GODOT_COPYRIGHT.txt`.

Commit the complete release source, push `main`, and wait for **Smoke Test
Export** and **Deploy Website to GitHub Pages** to succeed.

## 3. Create the immutable tag

With a clean working tree on the tested `main` commit, run:

```bash
./scripts/release_plugin.sh X.Y.Z
```

The script verifies version agreement, rebuilds the reproducible install ZIP,
refuses existing local or remote tags, and pushes `vX.Y.Z`. It does not upload
assets itself.

The tag-triggered **Release Plugin** workflow reruns the full export matrix,
verifies the ZIP and checksum, refuses an existing Release, and publishes:

- `godot_mini_game_vX.Y.Z.zip`
- `godot_mini_game_vX.Y.Z.zip.sha256`

## 4. Verify the published result

Confirm that the Release is neither a draft nor prerelease, both assets exist,
and the uploaded ZIP digest matches the local reproducible package. Finally,
open the public homepage and API reference to verify that they point to the new
release.

If a tag workflow fails before creating a Release, fix the cause on `main` and
publish a new patch version. Do not delete or retarget the failed tag.
